A project for practicing my knowledge of objects in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Once I finish this project, I will have prove that my abilities on JS, HTML and CSS are improving. As this requires a good planning before commencing the coding, my approach will focus on the solving-problem aspect: designing, finding and writing algorithms, etc. During the coding phase, my goal is to prioritize writing clean code.
